  </div>
  <p>As a young boy, I loved to play games. At points, there were game consoles in my home, but most of the time we didn't. We had a computer, and that is where most of my experiences with gaming came from. I played many online flash games in my childhood.</p>
  <p>Eventually, this lead to me wanting to know how to make games. So I searched google for "game maker." That's when I found the obviously named Game Maker software, used for, you guessed it, making games.</p>
  <p>From this point on, I was no longer just a player of games, but a maker of games. At first, I learned the drag and drop interface used for coding in Game Maker and made some simple games. Eventually, I decided I should learn it's scripting language, GML. After sinking a ton of time into the online forums, and in the included help files, I did manage to learn how to code. I continued to make projects, although I never seemed to finish with them.</p>

  <p>Eventually, my brother started branching out into different languages, and I followed him. This started my (so far) lifelong journey of learning new programming languages and becoming better at programming. Some of the languages I can now use are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>C/C++</li>
    <li>Haxe</li>
    <li>GML</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And I have dabbled with many more.</p>
  <p>However, to this day, Game Maker is still the most intiutive framework I know for making 2D games, and so holds a special place in my heart. Despite it's many oddities, it is a great software. I get nostalgic for it every now and then while I'm working with Haxe or Javascript.</p>
  <p>Maybe I can share some of my experience with you. Things have changed a lot, since then, however. Game Maker has gotten far more powerful (and far more expensive). The website is more modern and professional looking. The web archive still preserves the website I remember visiting as a shy kid, however.</p>
